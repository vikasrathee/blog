Hi, My name is Vikas Rathee and I am a Data Scientist by profession. Well, I guess you are here because you want to know more about me. Well here is my story. 

AFAIR, I was always interested in science part of life, which particularly for me was only physics. As nothing is certain in life I ended up becoming a computer scientist because of my strong interest for robots. I do confess till date I have not built a robot other than in pieces. I have a strong interest in studying, applying and improvising machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I wish to share all aspects (news, concepts, new advancements etc.) of my interest through this blog.
